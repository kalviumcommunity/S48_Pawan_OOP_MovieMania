## OOP Concepts
Moviemania demonstrates several key OOP concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: The game is structured around classes such as Question, Player, GameLevel, and Scoreboard. Objects are instances of these classes that manage game data and state.
- **Inheritance**: Different types of questions (e.g., MultipleChoiceQuestion, TrueFalseQuestion) inherit from a base Question class.
- **Polymorphism**: The game uses polymorphism to handle different question types uniformly, allowing the game to call askQuestion() on any question type.
- **Encapsulation**: Sensitive data, such as player scores and question details, is encapsulated within classes, providing controlled access through public methods.
- **Abstraction**: The game provides a simplified interface to players, hiding complex logic for question handling and score calculation.
- **Design Patterns**: The Factory Pattern is used to create different types of questions dynamically.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of some key classes in Moviemania:

- Question Class: Base class for all types of questions. Defines common properties and virtual methods for question handling.
